    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily
      serves coffee (of various types, e.g. espresso, latte, cappuccino). Some
      coffeehouses may serve cold drinks such as iced coffee and iced tea; in
      continental Europe, cafés serve alcoholic drinks. A coffeehouse may also
      serve food such as light snacks, sandwiches, muffins, fruit or pastries.
      Coffeehouses range from owner-operated small businesses to large
      multinational corporations. Some coffeehouse chains operate on a franchise
      business model, with numerous branches across various countries around the
      world.
